## FAQ

### Who the hell is JOSH?

I'm sure you meant _what_ the hell is JOSH, and it's quite simply the easiest storage system you'll ever encounter. JOSH will help you store any JSON-based data simply, effectively, into any popular database back-end.

### Why use JOSH?

The best reason to use JOSH is quite simply to get a project up and running as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible when it comes to the database interaction layer. It does this by removing the complexity of setting up and ORM or learning a database language, while still giving you all the power it can muster.

### When NOT to use JOSH?

If you think you can do better, if you already know database interactions or ORMs, or you don't trust database wrappers made by other people...
Well in any of those cases I don't even know why your on this page, go on now, `git out --of:here` and go make some good applications, you don't need this!
